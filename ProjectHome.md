Although there have been many recent advances in corpus-based tools, the techniques used to evaluate these systems have advanced little. Typically, the plausibility of a semantic space is explored by sampling nearest neighbors to a target word and evaluated based on the modeler’s intuition. Tools for visualization of these large-scale similarity spaces are nearly non-existent. Word 2 word is a new open-source tool to plot and visualize semantic spaces, allowing researchers to rapidly explore patterns in visual data representative of statistical relations between words. Words are visualized as nodes and word similarities as directed edges of varying strengths or thicknesses. The “Word 2 Word” visualization environment allows easy manipulation of graph data to test word similarity measures on their own accord or as a comparison between multiple similarity metrics. The system contains a large library of ready to use, modern, statistical relationship models along with an interface to teach them from various language sources. The modularity of the visualization environment allows for quick insertion of new similarity measures to compare new corpus-based metrics against current state of the art.
