#summary Preprocessing tools help normalize the semantic data

The preprocessing panel is available in the similarity wizard for most semantic space models. This allows you to select how the text is modified before it can be learned. The sentence cleaning tool allows you to stack a series of cleaners on top of each other. They will be performed in FIFO order. To select your list of cleaning tools, choose one of interest and select "add". This will add it to the top of the queue. More can then be added on top, or removed. Selecting the default button, will choose a reasonable set of cleaners for general purpose word learning.
