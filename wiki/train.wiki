#summary How to train a semantic space model

In the similarity wizard for most semantic space models, you will have the option of selecting what data your model learns from. Word 2 word provides a series of tools for selecting this data.

  * Learn from website: By selecting a website from the dropdown list or by typing in your own, W2W will attempt to download the html representation of that website.
  * Learn from file: A popup will allow you to select a file from your own computer.
  * Learn from directory: A popup will allow you to select a directory form your own computer. The system will then recursively learn all files in that directory of its sub-directories.
  * Learn from text: You can type or paste text in the textbox and learn that text only.

Note that you must select the learn button with the appropriate type of data source for the model to learn. *Simply typing text into the textbox or the url bar will not make the model learn the data*.

The message box below will update to indicate the status of the learning model. Most of the time the model will learn too fast to see what is happening, but large data sets may take some time.
