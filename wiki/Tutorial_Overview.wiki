Word 2 Word is a visualization platform designed to help understand relationships between words.

Words are visualized as nodes in a graph. Edges represent relationships between words with their strength displayed as a line thickness.

There are three major steps in using word 2 word.
  * Create one or more similarity metrics.
  * Select the relevant words.
  * Organize the words in the visualization.

This wiki guide is divided into three main parts, setup, tutorial and information.

  * [Tutorial_Setup Setup] will help you install the software and get it running.
  * [Tutorial_Tutorial Tutorial] will lead you through a set of examples. We think this is the easiest way to get antiquated with this tool.
  * [Tutorial_Information Information] will go into more in-depth information on the details of the system.
