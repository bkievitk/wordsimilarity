This can be found in the main menu->tools->clustering. This will perform clustering on the nodes. First select the number of groups you would like to cluster into. Then you can select the color for each group. Select a similarity metric from the drop down and select the clustering algorithm. Then select run.

The colors will then be assigned to the different clusters. Beware that as the clustering algorithms are non-deterministic, which color goes with which cluster will be arbitrary for each new run.

By running the clustering program, it will automatically set the color scheme of the nodes to individual color. This can be changed int he [options](visualization_options.md) panel.
