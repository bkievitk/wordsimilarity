Semantic space models do not necessarily generate similar distributions of similarities. Some like BEAGLE tend to generate mostly high similarities. This can make comparing these models a challenge. The transformation tool allows you to apply a transform to all of the similarities generated by a specific similarity metric.

to create a transform, select it in the similarity wizard. It will require an existing semantic model to perform a transform over. first select the model to use. A distribution will show up at the bottom of the screen. In order to facilitate speed of processing, this will not be a full histogram distribution but will instead be sample randomly from the data. Different transforms can then be applied (in FIFO order) by selecting the function from the drop down menu and then selecting add.
Some functions will require parameters (e.x. multiply requires the number to multiply by). These parameters can be set once the function has been added. The histogram will update to shown the original and current distribution. When an appropriate transform has been selected, select finish.

**Do not delete the semantic model that this similarity measure is using as this will destroy the transformed version as well**
