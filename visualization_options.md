Select color scheme in the color node. This allows you to select background, highlighted connection (when you hover over a node) and node color.

Node color can be constant (all the same), labeled as part of speech (uses wordnet if available to color each POS in a different color), or individual color (used for things like clustering to show specific color schemes).

The node tab allows you to select how the size of the node is rendered. This can be static or based on the frequency of the word.

There are also three options for showing the word labels.
