Word 2 Word is a visualization platform designed to help understand relationships between words.

Words are visualized as nodes in a graph. Edges represent relationships between words with their strength displayed as a line thickness.

There are three major steps in using word 2 word.
  * Create one or more similarity metrics.
  * Select the relevant words.
  * Organize the words in the visualization.

This wiki guide is divided into three main parts, setup, tutorial and information.
